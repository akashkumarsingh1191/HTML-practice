        Static:
            It is default value and element,no effect and not effected by top,bottom,left or right properties.
        Relative:
            We can provide left,right,top and bottom value to relative positioned HTML element.
        Fixed:
            Html element will be fixed when we scroll.
            It also work with left,right and top bottom properties.
        Absolute:
            It overlap HTML element,it move scrolling top and bottom
            And also effected by left,right,bottom and top properties.
        Stricky:
            It did not overlap element,and work like fixed and also affected by left,right and top,bottom properties.
